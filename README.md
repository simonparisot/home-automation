# Home automation projects!

Several projects that automate my home :D
They all make use of ESP8266 microcontroller for the hardware and AWS IoT Core for the IoT platform (using MQTT).
Control is done through Alexa and/or simple API calls.

## Light controller

Controls the lights in the house, through Alexa or ESP8266 connected physical switches (yes a lot of home wiring has been necessary!).

## Screen controller

Controls the home cinema electrical screen.

## Fish controller

Controls... a singing and dancing fish I used for various endeavors. 

## Papayop app

Web app using websockets to connect to MQTT to action some of the previous things.
